# Ezoic Ad Integration Guide

## Overview
Successfully integrated Ezoic ads across the Dunk Calculator website with strategic placements for optimal user experience and revenue generation.

## Ad Placement Strategy

### Placement IDs & Locations

#### Home Page (`/`)
- **ID 101**: After Hero Section - High visibility banner placement
- **ID 102**: After Calculator Results - Contextual placement when users get results
- **ID 104**: Before FAQ Section - End-of-content placement

#### Calculator Results Component
- **ID 103**: Between calculator results cards - In-content placement

#### Calculators Hub Page (`/calculators`)
- **ID 105**: After page header - Top placement on tools overview
- **ID 106**: Between calculator sections - Mid-content placement

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Reusable EzoicAd Component
```typescript
// Location: client/src/components/shared/ezoic-ad.tsx
// Features:
- Dynamic placement ID support
- Automatic script loading
- Custom styling classes
- Global window.ezstandalone integration
```

#### 2. Global Script Loading
```typescript
// Location: client/src/components/shared/ezoic-script.tsx
// Added to App.tsx for site-wide availability
```

#### 3. Strategic Integration Points
- **After engaging content**: Users are already invested
- **Between natural breaks**: Non-intrusive placement
- **Before conversion points**: FAQ sections, contact areas
- **In calculator results**: When users are most engaged
