# Dunk Calculator - User Guide

## How to Use the Dunk Calculator

### Step 1: Measure Your Height
**What you need:** A measuring tape and a flat wall

1. Stand against a wall with your back straight
2. Have someone mark the top of your head
3. Measure from floor to the mark
4. Enter the measurement in inches (e.g., 72 inches for 6 feet)

### Step 2: Measure Your Standing Reach
**What you need:** A measuring tape and a wall

1. Stand flat-footed against a wall
2. Reach up with one arm as high as possible
3. Keep your shoulder against the wall
4. Mark where your fingertips reach
5. Measure from floor to this mark
6. Enter the measurement in inches

**Important:** Standing reach is typically 1.2-1.4 times your height. If your measurement seems unusual, double-check it.

### Step 3: Select Rim Height
Choose from the preset options:
- **NBA/College (10 ft)**: Standard basketball rim height
- **Youth (9 ft)**: Common for youth leagues
- **Kids (8 ft)**: Elementary school height
- **Mini (7 ft)**: Beginner/practice rims

### Step 4: Set Desired Clearance
**Clearance** is how much space you want above the rim:
- **2-4 inches**: Minimal clearance (just touching rim)
- **4-6 inches**: Standard dunk clearance
- **6-8 inches**: Comfortable dunking room
- **8+ inches**: Aggressive dunking styles

### Step 5: Calculate and Interpret Results

## Understanding Your Results

### Required Vertical Jump
This shows exactly how many inches you need to improve your vertical leap:
- **0 inches**: You can already dunk!
- **1-6 inches**: Very achievable with 2-4 weeks of training
- **7-12 inches**: Realistic goal with 2-4 months of dedicated work
- **13-24 inches**: Challenging but possible with 6-12 months
- **25+ inches**: Requires specialized long-term training

### Hang Time
The total time you'll spend in the air during your jump:
- **Under 0.5 seconds**: Short, quick jump
- **0.5-0.7 seconds**: Average hang time
- **0.7-1.0 seconds**: Impressive air time
- **Over 1.0 seconds**: Elite-level hang time

### Power Output
The estimated watts of power needed for your jump:
- **Under 500W**: Light power requirement
- **500-1000W**: Moderate power needed
- **1000-1500W**: High power requirement
- **Over 1500W**: Elite athlete power levels

## Tips for Accurate Measurements

### Height Measurement
- Measure in the morning when you're tallest
- Remove shoes and keep feet flat
- Stand up straight with good posture
- Have someone else do the measuring for accuracy

### Standing Reach Measurement
- Keep both feet flat on the ground
- Don't go on your tiptoes
- Reach up with your dominant hand
- Keep your shoulder against the wall
- Stretch your fingers as high as possible

### Common Measurement Mistakes
- **Tiptoes**: Don't rise up on your toes during standing reach
- **Both Arms**: Use only one arm for standing reach
- **Shoes**: Remove shoes for both height and reach
- **Slouching**: Maintain good posture throughout

## Improving Your Vertical Jump

### Quick Wins (1-4 weeks)
- **Proper form**: Learn correct jumping technique
- **Flexibility**: Improve ankle and hip mobility
- **Core strength**: Strengthen your midsection
- **Weight loss**: Reduce body weight if overweight

### Medium-term Goals (1-4 months)
- **Plyometric training**: Jump-specific exercises
- **Strength training**: Build leg and core power
- **Regular practice**: Consistent jumping practice
- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase training intensity

### Long-term Development (6+ months)
- **Specialized programs**: Follow structured training plans
- **Olympic lifts**: Advanced power development
- **Sport-specific training**: Basketball-focused drills
- **Recovery optimization**: Proper rest and nutrition

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "My standing reach seems too high/low"
Double-check your measurement technique. Standing reach should be 1.2-1.4 times your height for most people.

### "The calculator says I need 30+ inches"
This indicates you'll need significant training. Consider:
- Lowering the rim height temporarily
- Reducing desired clearance
- Focusing on long-term improvement

### "I can already dunk but the calculator says I can't"
Factors not measured by the calculator:
- Running approach (adds 6-12 inches)
- Hand size and grip strength
- Jumping technique and timing
- Real-world vs. calculated scenarios

### "How accurate are these calculations?"
The calculator uses scientific physics formulas and provides estimates within 2-3 inches for most athletes. Individual factors like technique and coordination can affect real-world results.

## Troubleshooting

### Calculator Not Working
- Check that all fields have valid numbers
- Ensure standing reach is greater than height
- Try refreshing the page if visualization doesn't appear

### Results Seem Wrong
- Verify your measurements are in inches
- Double-check standing reach measurement
- Consider factors like running approach vs. standing jump

### Visualization Not Showing
- The graph appears after you calculate results
- Try using a different browser if issues persist
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

## Next Steps After Calculating

1. **Set realistic goals** based on your results
2. **Create a training plan** appropriate for your timeline
3. **Track progress** by re-measuring monthly
4. **Adjust training** based on improvements
5. **Stay consistent** with your program

Remember: Dunking is achievable for most people with dedicated training, regardless of starting point!
